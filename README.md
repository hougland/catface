# Catbook

## About

Catbook is a social networking site for cats to connect with other cats, all under their owners' watchful eyes.

It was developed in November 2015 by Ricky over Thanksgiving break while they were in Ada Developers Academy.

## Installation

Catbook was developed using Rails 4.2.4.

To install Catbook:

1. Clone the repo on your local computer, using this SSH link: `git@github.com:hougland/catface.git`

2. Run `bundle install` to download the gems.

3. Run `rake db:migrate` and `rake db:seed` for seed data.

4. Though there are currently no tests, once added, they will run via the `rspec` command.

...and you're good to go!

## Contribute

Ricky is currently accepting pull requests for improving Catbook's functionality and aesthetics. If you have experience working with Rails, please consider contributing.
