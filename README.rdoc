# Catbook

## About

Catbook is a social networking site for cats to connect with other cats, all under their owners' watchful eyes.

It was developed in November 2015 by Ricky over Thanksgiving break while they were in Ada Developers Academy.

Catbook was developed using Rails 4.2.4.

To install Catbook:
1. Clone the repo on your local computer, using this SSH link: `git@github.com:hougland/catface.git`
2. Run `bundle install` to download the gems.

..and you're good to go!
